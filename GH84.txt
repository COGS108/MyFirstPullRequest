#First COGS108 assignment

I am a bit behind with course materials, and discovered this assignment last minute.
I am thankful that I did come to know about it and felt the urge to start and complete it right away,
amidst fears that I was already too late have enough time for it.

Honestly, COVID-19 may have made academics easier for some people - within both groups 
of students and professors - but for me, it has been quite difficult. 

Both of my parents' jobs were greatly impacted by the pandemic, and living has been
quite difficult. But I will persevere, because my family was granted safety and good health
during this crisis. So I will make no excuses but try harder to stay on top of all due dates and
materials!! Honestly I have so much free time. This is so doable. Thank you Professor and TAs 
for trying your hardest and preparing this course to be able to be handled remotely and online. 
It is just a personal obstacle of mine that I find difficult navigating thoroughly through 
class materials and news online. 

If this is read, hope all of you are safe and well!
May this month of 2020 be another unique month of October!

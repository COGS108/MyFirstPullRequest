This is a empty file .. wait its not HAHA... why use VIM when I can just edit directly using vscode text editor LOL 
Adding some edits to do a git pull to my local machine 
I actually did a git fetch, then a git merge 
Let me try again using a git pull, I am assuming it would combine the two steps into one step. 
Here is more editing I am doing on vim via vim AN29.txt using 'a' command followed by :wq 
Here is some more changes hehe 
more change 
even more changes 
even more changes so i can make another commit message LOL

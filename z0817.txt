To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand swsh. The meta is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical pokephysics most of the game will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Ohmiro's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his games- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Bullshitgamedesignerlnaya Volya literature, for instance. The brand loyal zombies understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this game, to realise that they’re not just fun- they say something deep about POKEMON. As a consequence people who dislike swsh truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Ohmori existential catchphrase “High fidelity animations,” which itself is a cryptic reference Masudagenev’s I really don't know how to make games I was originally a composer for the original. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as SHIGERU OHMORI genius wit unfolds itself on their switch screens. What fools.. how I pity them. :joy:

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Charizard tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within the range of my own (preferably lower) IVs . Nothin personnel kid.

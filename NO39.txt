You are going to add a text file with a unique identifier to your repo

    The unique identifier should be: the first letter of your first name (capitalized) + the first letter of your last name (capitalized) + the last 2 digits of your Student ID (PID).
    For example, John Smith - A12345678 should submit 'JS78.txt'.
    The contents of this file do not matter (it can be empty).
    Add this file to your cloned repository (the folder on your computer).
    Note: A 'txt' file is a plain text file. It should have the extension '.txt'. You may need to specify, in your preferred text editor, to save this filetype.

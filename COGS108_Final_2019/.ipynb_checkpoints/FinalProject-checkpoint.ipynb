    "From 2013-2018, the United States of America has gone through a period of time when there were over 260,000 reported occurrence of gun violence. With so many reported incidents within the span of only 5 years, there needs to be a way for citizens to find where all these incidents are occurring without having to sift through heaps of data. People should be aware of where areas of high gun violence rates are occurring and how possible prevention can occur. We seek to find out whether or not gun violence rates, household income level, and population level are correlated and if so, can there be a way to lower the gun violence rates in those areas. To operationalize this, we are using gun violence rates, household income levels, and population counts as our metrics since all three can be utilized for our research question of whether there is a correlation between income and gun violence within an area of the United States."

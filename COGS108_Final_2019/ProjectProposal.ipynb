    "Gun violence has been an especially salient topic in the past couple years with the amount of coverage it has received in the media.  It is an issue that is politically charged, leading to heated debate on what steps should be taken in order to reduce its incidence rates across the United States.  We were interested in this topic because while debate and discussion on isolated events of gun violence can provide valuable insight, clear data must be presented to support an argument to pass any amendments to current gun laws in the states, and see what other factors are affecting the problem (like economic level of a region).  \n",
    "We have found several projects online that outline this topic’s importance and statistical validity. The first one is a web app that provides a calendar heat map of gun violence in the United States based on geographical area. It found that the city with the worst gun problem in the US was Chicago.  The second project attempts to predict the death rate from gun laws. “Based on regression tree analysis of 18 years of CDC firearm death rates and gun laws by State, the number of State gun laws in 10 categories predicts annual deaths per 100,000 residents”\n",

    "We plan to remove any rows with null values that would upset the data.  Significant outliers will be identified and removed as well. We also have a lot of extraneous information that we would probably want to remove just to make parsing our data faster. For example, our income data set contains state, city, and county, but we may only need one of them.\n",

    "Data Analysis:\n",
    "Our primary method we plan to use is a heat map on the US to indicate the density of gun violence as well as a separate heat map to indicate the average income in the US. Then, we would have a combined heat map to show the trend between economic status and rates of gun violence. We hope that having three separate maps rather than just one combined map would be beneficial to see more trends than just economic status to gun violence. Being able to see the general economic status might be beneficial in understanding why certain areas are poorer than others. Seeing rates of gun violence may also show us that certain areas are more prolific with gun purchases and gun use, which we can use to understand why. For example, we know that certain states like Texas are more pro-gun, and this may be a reflection of political views or societal biases in those areas. \n",

    "All datasets used in our project come from sources which allow free public access/use for open-source use.\n",
    "Are there privacy concerns regarding your datasets that you need to deal with, and/or terms of use that you need to comply with?\n",
    "There should not be any privacy concerns regarding our datasets because the data provided comes from government/media/law enforcement/commercial sources, meaning that we are authorized to use what we have found for our own purposes after citation of our sources.\n",
    "Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis? (For example, does your data exclude particular populations, or is it likely to reflect particular human biases in a way that could be a problem?)\n",
    "Based on our hypothesis, we believe that our data may be biased towards certain areas with a general economic status. More specifically, we believe that there may not be as much incident representation towards higher income areas of the United States as there may be for lower income areas, which could negatively affect equity and bias in terms of data covered in our analysis.\n",
    "Are there any other issues related to your topic area, data, and/or analyses that are potentially problematic in terms of data privacy and equitable impact?\n",
    "One issue that may affect our project in terms of equitable impact is that our datasets thus far are connecting income/economic status to crime rates. Our fear, in this case, is that we are not fully identifying why gun violence crimes occur in certain areas, as economic status might not be the sole reason that connects these areas and gun violence together.\n",
    "How will you handle any issues you identify?\n",
    "We plan to handle these issues by also collecting the source articles/news from our Gun Violence dataset, taking these into account in the analysis and discussion portions of our project. We will use some specific circumstances of gun violence crimes to relate and argue for/against different perspectives of certain areas of the United States to explain different factors of crimes.\n",

    "We believe that if our analyses and hypotheses are correct, we would be able to aid in communities that have high rates of gun violence and possibly bring attention to the issues that plague lower income areas. Ideally, we would be able to bring up reforms that not only benefit specific communities, but also bring attention to the issues with gun laws in the US such as obtaining a firearm. These areas tend to lack the proper infrastructure among other things, so our results may lead to improving those facets. \n",
    "\tEven if our methods and/or hypotheses are wrong, we would still be able to posit something useful since gun violence is such a prolific issue in the US currently. Simply by the mass of our dataset we can conclude that gun violence is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with. If there is no clear trend with gun violence and socioeconomic status, then it may mean that gun laws are so weak that anybody can commit gun violence anywhere. \n",
    "\tOne potential pitfall we may run into is that since our data is mainly focusing on income of households in the US, we may not have enough information on other important factors such as race or crime rates in general for that area. Our Income data also contains far less observations than the gun crime dataset so for certain areas we may lack the data to tie in gun violence with income. Furthermore, we may only find a correlational result rather than a causal ones since we are not certain that economic status is the sole reason for gun violence.\n"

To know oneself, to learn to think, to act as if nothing were self evident-wondering, "wondering that there is being"-these, and
many other determinations of philosophy create interesting attitudes,
however tiresome they may be in the long run, but even from a
pedagogical point of view they do not constitute a well-defined occupation or precise activity. On the other hand, the following definition
of philosophy can be taken as being decisive: knowledge through
pure concepts. But there is no reason to oppose knowledge through
concepts and the construction of concepts within possible experience
on the one hand and through intuition on the other. For, according
to the Nietzschean verdict, you will know nothing through concepts
unless you have first created them-that is, constructed them in an
intuition specific to them: a field, a plane, and a ground that must not
be confused with them but that shelters their seeds and the personae
who cultivate them. Constructivism requires every creation to be a
construction on a plane that gives it an autonomous existence. To
create concepts is, at the very least, to make something. This alters
the question of philosophy's use or usefulness, or even of its harmfulness (to whom is it harmful?)

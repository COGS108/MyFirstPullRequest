1. Is any government always better than no government? Give examples. 


        Any government is not always better than no government. Anarchy can be less violent and unjust than a totalitarian, fascist state. For instance, the Northern Syria society Rojava declared itself autonomous from the Syrian government in 2013 and has prospered in a virtually government-free “libertarian municipalism”. As Locke stated in his Second Treatise, people can live in a state of harmony and natural law without the use of a governing body. In contrast, having an official government can very easily become an unpleasant affair. Take for example the current American government, which despite its widespread reputation as a state of equality has instituted laws limiting access to health care and citizenship. 


        
1. What human motivations might prompt and might support the formation and stable maintenance of a just government? How and why? 


        A just government is formed in the interest of defending the commonwealth. The motivation to create such security comes from the human desire for peace and the avoidance of the chaos that can result from the lack of a social contract.  This desire additionally can motivate us to institute laws and checks and balances of power to ensure this peace is not threatened. For this, a just government must have a monopoly on violence within the state. The human motivation for peace and security helps form and maintain such a government because we are all aware, and importantly, afraid, of the alternative. Fear motivates a just government as much as the desire for peace.
